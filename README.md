Hey you! You actually scanned the QR code!
(If not I have no clue why you are here...)

Here are instructions to build this! 

<h2>Instructions to build:</h2>

You need a 3D Printer, an Arduino, a computer, a breadboard, a handful of wires, a 330Ω resistor, a button, a 9V battey and connector, and one mini servo.

Connect all of your parts as shown in this diagram.

For the code, go to the code.ino file. Paste it into the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software if you dont have it). Plug your arduino into your computer and upload it.

After that, you need to 3D print the parts. Go to the STL file to get them. (I designed these.)

When you finished that, screw the Arduino into the arduino_uno_bottom part. Next, assemble the DROPPER.stl file by glueing the bigger flat piece to the top to make a chamber that holds the projectile. Then slide the servo into place, and glue it. This next step is tricky. Take the smaller square and glue it onto the arm of the servo and make sure it can allow the servo to open and close the chamber. Load your cat treats.

Mount the Arduino to a wall.
